# Pymaceuticals, Inc. Animal Study Analysis

Welcome to the Pymaceuticals, Inc. repository! This repository contains the findings of a comprehensive animal study conducted by Pymaceuticals, Inc., focusing on potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer.

## Analysis Summary
In this study, 249 mice with SCC tumors were treated with various drug regimens over a period of 45 days. The key findings of the analysis are as follows:

- **Tumor Volume Reduction**: Capomulin and Ramicane emerged as the most effective treatments for reducing tumor volume, with average tumor volumes around 40 mmÂ³, notably lower than other regimens.
  
- **Weight-Tumor Volume Correlation**: A strong correlation (0.84) between weight and tumor average volume was observed, indicating that heavier mice tend to have larger tumors.
  
- **Onset of Capomulin Effects**: Capomulin exhibited noticeable effects after 10 to 20 days of treatment, resulting in a dramatic reduction in tumor volume.
  
- **Gender Distribution**: The dataset had nearly equal representation between male and female specimens.

- **Boxplot Insights**: Tumors treated with Infubinol and Ceftamin often experienced continued growth, while Capomulin and Ramicane demonstrated significant reduction in tumor volume. However, an outlier in the Infubinol group showcased a substantial improvement in tumor volume.
